## Project Overview of the Analysis
#### The goal of this project was to analyze the outcomes of six different methods of evaluating credit risk.
Using a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending services company, each of the methods was used to create training and target variables and then make predictions through the use of the `LogisticRegression` classifier.  The accuracy of each model's performance was then evaluated by the calculation of an accuracy score of those predictions.  Finally, a confusion matrix was generated in which the predictions were assigned based on their accuracy and an imbalanced classification report was printed out.  For the purposes of this analysis, two classes were determined:  `low-risk` and `high-risk`.
