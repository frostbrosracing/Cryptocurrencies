# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview of the Analysis
#### The goal of this project was to use Python, Pandas, and unsupervised machine learning to; process a dataset, cluster, reduce the dimensions and reduce the principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
A report was created that informs investors what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and groups them to create a classification system.  To do this, a clustering algorithm was used.
